# Persistence support for RadioLib
Utility functions for enabling persistence, mainly for LoRaWAN support in RadioLib.

Currently, examples are available for the following protocols and platforms:
* [LoRaWAN for ESP32](https://github.com/radiolib-org/radiolib-persistence/tree/main/examples/LoRaWAN_ESP32): ESP32 and all related versions, such as -S3 (last tested on Heltec Wireless Stick Lite V3 @ RadioLib 7.1.0)
* [LoRaWAN for ESP8266](https://github.com/radiolib-org/radiolib-persistence/tree/main/examples/LoRaWAN_ESP8266) (last tested on Ai-Thinker ESP8266 NodeMCU V2 coupled with SX1262 @ RadioLib 6.5.0)
